# AUTOMATIC-MULTI-TRACK-MIXING-USING-LINEAR-DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------
MATLAB Implementation of Scott et al. 2011 with Feature Modifications

Zafrin_Chudwick_MIR_FP.m is the main script which executes the auto mix.

In the stem_files folder, each function loads in a different song and group of multi-tracks for a specific song.

All other functions are used throughout the algorithm and implementation.
